subtitle: Education, Projects, Interests, and all of that...

My name is Lea Cohausz and I'm a PhD student specializing in Artificial Intelligence at the <a href="https://www.uni-mannheim.de/dws/people/researchers/phd-students/">University of Mannheim</a>. I have the notorious habit of being interested in many things which is reflected in pretty much every aspect of my life. 


### Research Interests

- causal modelling and causal structure learning
- combining causal inference and predictive models
- XAI and fairness
- much of the above in the context of Educational Data Mining
- AI-Planning and Reinforcement Learning for Goal and Plan Recognition
- reasoning about human behavior in general

If you are interested in any of these topics, feel free to reach out to me.

### Teaching

- Decision Support: Master-level course on the basics of probability theory, graphical models (in particular BNs), utility theory, game theory, and reinforcement learning
- Industrial Applications of AI (my sessions: agriculture/computer vision and education/XAI/causal modelling and XAI): hands-on Master-level course 


### Interests Outside Academia

I do actually have interests outside academia... I enjoy to be outside, going on hikes, bouldering, and being a volunteer firefighter.


### Social Engagement
- volunteer firefighter in Mannheim
- co-organizing the <a href="https://wuman.de/wids/">Women in Data Science Event</a> in Mannheim
- currently inactive sports coach
