My name is Lea and I'm a PhD student specializing in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Mannheim. I have the notorious habit of being interest in many things which is reflected in pretty much every aspect of my life. Let's start with my research interests:

- AI-Planning for Goal and Plan Recognition
- Reinforcement Learning (in the context of Goal Recognition but not limited to that)
- Educational Data Mining 
- relating to that: XAI

### Interests oustide Academia

I do actually have interests outside academia... but I also like to play around with Computer Vision in my free time. Apart from that, I like to be outside, enjoy going on hikes, bouldering, and being a volunteer firefighter.
