My name is Lea Cohausz and I'm a PhD student specializing in Artificial Intelligence at the <a href="https://www.uni-mannheim.de/dws/research/focus-groups/artificial-intelligence-prof-stuckenschmidt/">University of Mannheim</a>. I have the notorious habit of being interested in many things which is reflected in pretty much every aspect of my life. 

### Research Interests

- AI-Planning and Reinforcement Learning for Goal and Plan Recognition
- Educational Data Mining 
- relating to that: XAI
- reasoning about human behavior in general

If you are interested in any of these topics, feel free to reach out to me.

- Industrial Applications of AI (my sessions: agriculture/computer vision and learning analytics/XAI): hands-on Master-level course 


### Interests Outside Academia

I do actually have interests outside academia... but I also like to play around with Computer Vision in my free time. Apart from that, I enjoy to be outside, going on hikes, bouldering, and being a volunteer firefighter.
