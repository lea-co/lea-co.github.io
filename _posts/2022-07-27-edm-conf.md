My paper **Towards Real Interpretability of Student Success Prediction Combining Methods of XAI and Social Science** won the Best Student Short Paper Award at the EDM '22. It was great to meet and exchange ideas with my fellow scientists who were very welcoming towards me as a newcomer. 

What the EDM-comittee had to say about my paper:
"Considers the limits of common explainable AI methods for
intervening to improve student success based on predictive
models, introducing a new approach for explanation that
leverages reasoning about counterfactuals. The committee
particularly appreciated how the paper combined technical
solutions from multiple disciplines to provide actionable
information with the potential to directly help students and
teachers."
