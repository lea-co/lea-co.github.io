My journal article *When Probabilities Are Not Enough - A Framework for Causal Explanations of Student Success Models*, an extension of my EDM paper, was published in the Journal of Educational Data Mining. I cannot thank the editors and reviewers enough for their valuable and to-the-point feedback as well as for their patience in guiding me to my first journal publication.
